# Supabase Database Linter Ignore List
# 
# This file documents indexes that should be ignored by the linter
# even though they may appear unused. These indexes are required for
# foreign key constraint checks and cascading operations.
#
# Note: Supabase may not currently support .linterignore files, but
# this file documents the indexes that should be ignored if/when
# support is added.

# Foreign Key Indexes - Keep Even If Unused
