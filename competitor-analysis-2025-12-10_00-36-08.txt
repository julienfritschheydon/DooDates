ANALYSIS:
The text highlights features DooDates may not have: Booking Pages, 1:1 scheduling tools, 
and extensive integrations with calendar and video conferencing platforms. It also indicates 
a focus on user education through comprehensive articles and dedicated troubleshooting sections. 
DooDates could consider developing similar features and resources to enhance its scheduling capabilities and user support.

Calendly's new "Meeting Polls" feature allows users to vote on meeting times and directly book the meeting 
within the platform, streamlining the scheduling process. They also have a browser extension enabling quick 
link sharing within LinkedIn Messaging, improving accessibility and convenience. DooDates should explore similar

Category: Date Polls
ANALYSIS:
Rallly's recent updates heavily focus on security patches (multiple CVEs), dependency updates, and bug 
fixes related to authentication (OIDC, Google/Microsoft redirects) and email delivery. One potential 
feature to note is "Show pinging indicator when there are invisible options", which could improve UX 
by subtly hinting at hidden data. The introduction of password-based login alongside existing session 
management could be a strategic shift towards wider accessibility and user preference.
